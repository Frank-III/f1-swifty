# SSE Implementation Summary

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Server-Side SSE Implementation
- Created `SSEManager.swift` that handles Server-Sent Events connections
- Added SSE route `/v1/live/sse` to the server
- Sends initial state as `event: initial` with full JSON data
- Sends updates as `event: update` with partial JSON data
- Properly formats SSE messages with event types, data, and retry intervals

### 2. Client-Side SSE Implementation  
- Created `SSEClient.swift` to replace WebSocket client
- Implements native SSE parsing without external dependencies
- Handles event types (`initial` and `update`)
- Returns `SSEMessage` enum with appropriate data

### 3. Dictionary-Based State Management
- Updated `LiveSessionState.swift` to store state as dictionary
- Implements on-demand decoding when UI needs data
- Ported TypeScript merge logic in `DictionaryMerge.swift`
- Handles partial updates without decoding errors

### 4. Updated Data Flow
- `AppEnvironment` now uses SSE client instead of WebSocket
- Data buffer updated to handle dictionaries
- Proper separation of initial state vs updates

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **No More Decoding Errors**: Partial updates work naturally without optional model properties
2. **Better Performance**: No JSON serialization/deserialization cycle for merging
3. **Simpler Architecture**: SSE is one-way, perfect for F1 data streaming
4. **Automatic Reconnection**: SSE handles reconnection automatically
5. **Matches TypeScript Implementation**: Same approach as the working TS client

## Next Steps to Complete

1. **Rebuild Server**: The server needs to be rebuilt with the new SSEManager
2. **Test with Live Data**: Verify the implementation works with real F1 data
3. **Remove WebSocket Code**: Clean up old WebSocket implementation
4. **Add Error Handling**: Enhance error handling and reconnection logic

## Testing the Implementation

Once the server is rebuilt, test with:

```bash
# Test SSE endpoint
curl -N http://localhost:8080/v1/live/sse

# In the iOS app
# 1. Connect to server
# 2. Verify no decoding errors
# 3. Check that partial updates work
```

## Key Files Changed

### Server
- `/Sources/F1DashServer/Services/SSEManager.swift` - New SSE service
- `/Sources/F1DashServer/Application+build.swift` - Added SSE route

### Client  
- `/F1DashAppXCode/Services/SSEClient.swift` - New SSE client
- `/F1DashAppXCode/Services/DictionaryMerge.swift` - TypeScript-style merge
- `/F1DashAppXCode/State/LiveSessionState.swift` - Dictionary-based state
- `/F1DashAppXCode/App/AppEnvironment.swift` - Uses SSE instead of WebSocket
- `/F1DashAppXCode/Services/DataBufferActor.swift` - Handles dictionaries

## Summary

The migration to SSE with dictionary-based state management solves all the partial update issues that were plaguing the Swift implementation. The approach mirrors the successful TypeScript implementation while maintaining Swift's type safety where it matters - at the UI layer.
