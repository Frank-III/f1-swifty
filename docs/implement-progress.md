# Implementation Progress

This document tracks the feature parity between the functionality described in the project's documentation (`docs/f1-dash-server.md` and `docs/f1-dash-client.md`) and the current implementation in the `Sources` directory.

There is a notable architectural difference:
-   **Documentation:** Describes a Rust-based backend and a web-based (Next.js) frontend.
-   **Implementation:** Consists of a native Swift stack, including a Hummingbird-based server (`F1DashServer`) and a native SwiftUI client for macOS/iOS (`F1DashApp`).

This report maps the features from the documented architecture to their corresponding implementations in the Swift codebase.

### Summary & Areas for Improvement

**Server (`F1DashServer`)**
-   **Strengths:** The Swift server successfully implements the core real-time data pipeline: connecting to the F1 feed, processing data, and broadcasting it to clients via WebSockets. It also includes a simulation mode, a basic REST API, and a full data persistence and analytics backend.
-   **Gaps:** The server implementation is now feature-complete compared to the documented Rust version.

**Client (`F1DashApp`)**
-   **Strengths:** The native SwiftUI client provides a robust and feature-rich dashboard experience for macOS, including a unique menu bar popover. It covers most of the critical real-time views: leaderboard, track map, race control, weather, session status, championship standings, tire strategy, and car telemetry. It also has a comprehensive settings system and full audio playback for team radio.
-   **Gaps:**
    1.  **Weather Radar Map:** The detailed weather radar map with timeline for rain visualization is not implemented.
    2.  **Race Schedule:** Views for the full race schedule are missing.
    3.  **Track Violations:** No specific view for track limit violations.
